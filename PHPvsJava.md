PHP vs Java
===========

A choice had to be made early on about which technology to use for the site's backend. This choice was narrowed down quickly to backend-suitable languages which have some formal instruction for students studying Computer Science/Computing at Leicester: Java, PHP and JavaScript. JavaScript was ruled out to diversify the technologies used in the project, since it's guaranteed to be used on the front end.

The choice then was between Java and PHP. A Facebook group poll had the languages tied for support (3 votes for each). The technical decision taken was based on the following criteria:

- Ease of use and setup
- Past group member experience
- Applicability to future projects/to future careers

Ease Of Use
-----------
PHP is widely renown as being very easy to use and setup; indeed, our hosting platform comes with a "LAMP" (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) server implementation as standard.

Java is also easy to use; arguably less so than PHP, but when taking into consideration the considerable experience of most of the group members with Java there is no argument that it would be easy for the group to get up and running in a web development project using Java.

Java is not, however, easy to set up. The verbosity of Java setup using various frameworks can be extensive, and setting up a test environment for everybody could be a challenge.

The downside to PHP would be that the language itself contains many "warts", or bizarre or unintuitive features which can make bugs hard to find or can waste time while developers are confused (e.g. the content of [lolphp](https://www.reddit.com/r/lolphp/).

Despite this, we detemined PHP to be the winner here due to the easier setup.

Past Group Member Experience
----------------------------
As mentioned before, all group members have extensive experience in Java from university projects, but experience in Java web development is limited to one group project which may have had a wide disparity in quality.

A few group members have past experience in PHP web development, in non-university settings, although not necessarily in the frameworks we would use.

This category could be considered to be a draw between the two languages, but Java possibly slightly wins because every group member is guaranteed to have used the language multiple times per semester.

Future Applicability
--------------------

This category was largely simple; while Java is definitely used in a huge amount of web applications worldwide and has a thriving job market, Java experience is not at all hard to come by for people studying at Leicester. In comparison, the PHP course comprises only a small fraction of one module, using outdated PHP styles. PHP is the winner here, simply because gaining experience in a wide variety of languages will help to diversify programmer talent and open up more job opportunities.

Overall
-------

The language chosen is PHP; this is despite some group members disliking the language and the design choices behind it. We believe that diversifying our skills is good, and the ease of setup is the cherry on the cake.

That said, there are many failures of PHP. To mitigate this, we intend to use a modern web framework to avoid the "spaghetti code" nature of PHP sprinkled across various files, and some restrictions will be enforced to avoid PHP's lacking type system causing problems.
